For all designs I ask you to make, have them be beautiful, not cookie cutter. Make webpages that are fully featured and worthy for production.

By default, this template supports JSX syntax with Tailwind CSS classes, React hooks, and Lucide React for icons. Do not install other packages for UI themes, icons, etc unless absolutely necessary or I request them.

Goal: Fix build/parse/runtime issues in this repo without changing any working functionality, visual appearance, content strings, or behavior.

Hard rules (MUST):

Do not change business logic, function/component/variable names, UI strings, DOM ordering, or CSS class names â€” unless absolutely required to fix parsing and the change does not affect render output.

Do not add/remove/upgrade dependencies without human approval.

All edits must be minimal, AST-aware, reversible. If uncertain, produce a safe patch and request approval.
